## What problem we are solving?

**We are solving the problem of creators who don't receive real value for their humorous content. They only get "Likes" and "reputation," and have brand deals as their only earning option, while social media platforms capture all the direct monetary value. Funny content can reach millions in no time, but creators get no tangible reward for their humor, creativity, and time investment.**

## Solution
**SuperFunSocial is a social gaming app on Farcaster & Ton where users can earn crypto rewards for creating entertaining content and playing games.**

## Key Features
* **Feed:** A place to view and share funny content.
* **Game:** Engage in entertaining games and earn rewards.
* **Store:** Buy and sell digital assets and NFTs.
* **Leaderboard:** Track top performers and compete for the top spot.

## Smart Contracts
We have created smart contracts for various functionalities including an NFT collection contract, an NFT item contract for FunPass, and a different NFT contract for GameAsset.
